    ncog.id is a privacy-focused identity service that is geared towards game developers who want to easily add compliant account management to their games. It is being developed by and for [Khonsu Labs](https://khonsulabs.com/). While writing games, Jon [(aka @ecton)](https://twitter.com/ectonDev) will be also be looking to add services that hopefully simplify some aspects of game development, including asset management and delivery, cutting-edge localization using [fluent](https://projectfluent.org), inventory management, and others.

    The goal is to be a consumer-focused service that goes above and beyond in complying with privacy and safety laws including GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, and others. It will take a lot of effort to fulfill that goal, and as such, while this service is in development, this service is offered as-is with no guarantees. **Your data will likely be erased multiple times during development.**
